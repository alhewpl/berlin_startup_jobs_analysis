       "  'description': 'test IO is a global leader in software crowdtesting. Thousands of qa testers work with us to test mobile apps, websites, IoT software, and more.\\nTesters who work with us come from all walks of life. Some are software developers or testers, looking to hone their skills or test on new platforms. Others are tech enthusiasts who turn their passion into extra cash. And some are students or are transitioning into a new career, earning while learning. With test IO, you can work when, where, and how you want.\\nThere’s no application process. You can get started here: http://hello.test.io/bsj/\\nRequirements\\nYou’ll be working as a freelance tester, with opportunities to participate in test runs at your own discretion. You don’t need to have experience in software QA (though you’ll get up to speed faster if you do), but you’ll need to stick with it if you’ve never done it before. If you haven’t tested before, here are some key success factors:\\nYou read instructions and understand them. If the instructions say that something is out of scope and you test it, you’re wasting your own time.\\nYou communicate precisely in English. Bug reporting is a particular form of communication that demands precision, concise wording, and logical ordering.\\nYou are curious. The best testers aren’t robots who follow a script. They like things that seem mysterious. They deviate from the Happy Path. They like to experiment with apps.\\nYou spot patterns. Similar bugs occur in unrelated software systems, so being able to sense patterns is very helpful.\\nYou like games. There does seem to be a high degree of overlap between testers and gamers. Part of it is the thrill of the hunt, and the desire to understand the rules of a system and how to beat them.\\nWhen you start as a tester at test IO, you’ll get coaching from team leaders, then participate in test cycles with more experienced testers. You’ll get the opportunity to see the kinds of issues they find and how they find them, so you’ll be able to learn as you go along.\\nYou will need a computer and an internet connection. Ideally you will also have access to one or more mobile devices. The more devices you have, the more opportunities you’ll have to test. Don’t worry if you don’t have the latest hardware; there’s strong demand for older devices, too.\\nBenefits\\nAs a tester, you can work whenever you want, from wherever you want. You’ll be presented with opportunities to participate in tests, which you may accept or reject with no penalty. You will be paid for issues you find, issues that you reproduce, and sometimes for reviews of the software under test. More serious issues get higher payouts, up to $50 per bug. You’ll know the payscale before you agree to test.\\nThere’s no formal application process. You can get started right away by signing up here: http://hello.test.io/bsj/\\nYou’ll then proceed to your first test, where we will help you learn how to file reports on the issues you find.',\n",

But in case you haven’t, here’s what we do: we take the raw transaction data that subscription businesses – like Pipedrive, Typeform and Travis CI – generate when they bill their customers, and turn it into high level business metrics – like Monthly Recurring Revenue and churn rate – that they use to make their businesses grow faster than ever. We give almost anyone the tools to segment and analyse this data, instantly, without bothering a BI team. We’re democratising analytics.\\nWe’d love to say all this was powered by amazing, gleaming code, perfectly architected and running on an automated, containerised fleet of servers. But we’re a young company – just 3 years old, and 20 people – and we’ve made our share of mistakes as we’ve grown. There’s a certain amount of (though not too much) of technical debt. Our main Rails application only has a Code Climate GPA of 3.15. And there are some architectural decisions we’d definitely make differently with the benefit of hindsight. We’re learning all the time how to be better engineers.\\nBut we’re doing a lot of cool stuff too. We use Rust in production. Our customers love us, and we’re growing – which brings challenges with it. And we’re looking for a first dedicated Frontend Engineer to keep improving our UI, and making our customers’ lives easier every day.\\nWhat we’re looking for: \\n\\nA few years’ experience working with single-page applications in a modern, JavaScript stack.\\nExperience with Marionette / Backbone, which we presently use, would be particularly great.\\nGood knowledge of the browser environment, and JavaScript toolchains.\\nA good understanding of building solid, maintainable code.\\nYou speak fluent Git, and English.\\nYou like working with other team members, and even customers to understand and solve their problems.\\n\\nWhat we offer:\\nObviously, we offer good salaries to attract great people to ChartMogul.

We love open-source. We are a very international team with interesting people from all over the world (95% of us have relocated to Berlin).How we workWe strongly believe in the importance of uninterrupted time to get stuff done and quality over quantity when it comes to working hours. We prefer to keep our schedule meeting-light and work in a library-like atmosphere during the core hours.We believe the ability to give and get constructive feedback and express divergent ideas is crucial to make innovation come to life. We live a very open discussion culture and prefer the evaluation of ideas based on merit over top-down decision making.We strongly believe in ownership of one\\'s features, from spec to implementation to operation. We also understand that ownership comes with a sense of responsibility towards others that depend on the results of our work.We believe that that everybody should be able to find meaning in their work. We match assignments based on both ability and individual interests and discuss your progress and individual needs every 3 months.We don\\'t see people as \"resources\" and genuinely care about each other. We also understand that there\\'s more than fancy perks and cool events to people\\'s satisfaction and engagement. We continuously work towards an environment providing a lot of autonomy, transparency and development opportunities and rely on everybody\\'s feedback to hold us accountable for maintaining our high standards.About the interview processHow we get to know each otherWe like to start out with a brief 20-30min session for a mutual introduction. We tell you about our company, product and culture and are happy to answer any questions you might have. From your side, we\\'re mostly interested in understanding what kind of challenges you\\'re looking for, what technologies you\\'d like to work with and what role you\\'d like to be in.If both sides agree that this could be a good fit, we move on to a more technical session. We ask you to walk us through one of your past projects as if we were new colleagues joining you on the job. The ability to communicate effectively and concisely about complex systems and trade-offs between different approaches is key.In a second technical session, we discuss some of the technologies and concepts you have used. We also give you a walk-through of our product and solutions, discuss our architecture and components. Finally we try to scope your initial role and focus — should you be joining us.In the last session, we discuss the remaining details, logistics and plan your relocation.We see the interview process as a mutual opportunity to get to know each other — at eye level. That\\'s why we won\\'t ask you to work for free on any coding assignments and always strive for responding within hours, not weeks.',\n",

This tool then turns their code into stateless functions, that can be easily deployed into powerful data pipelines.The stackDocker, Kubernetes, Rancher, AnsibleThe challengeHaving great DevOps engineering support is crucial in order to guarantee that our micro-service based platform runs smoothly and reliably, no matter where it is deployed (we support cloud and on-premise deployments).Our components are mostly written in Go, with some Scala and a bit of Python mixed in and all of them expose well-defined interfaces. We always keep operational requirements in mind when developing new services.We\\'re looking for someone who can actively drive our roadmap in the area as part of our technical operations team, who can evaluate new technologies and wants to be a great partner for the rest of the tech team.Your profileYou have senior-level experience with complex production deployments, know your way around Kubernetes and have in depth operational experience with at least one of the big three cloud providers (AWS, gcloud, Azure).Software engineering experience is a big plus, particularly in Go.About usWho we areContiamo is a Berlin-based, fast-growing tech company. We offer a flexible data platform enabling businesses to create interactive, data-driven decision tools and automations. Our mission is to combine sophisticated data science with a great user interface and experience.We are a tech-driven company and keep a close watch on recent scientific developments and emerging technologies. We love open-source. We are a very international team with interesting people from all over the world (95% of us have relocated to Berlin).How we workWe strongly believe in the importance of uninterrupted time to get stuff done and quality over quantity when it comes to working hours. We prefer to keep our schedule meeting-light and work in a library-like atmosphere during the core hours.We believe the ability to give and get constructive feedback and express divergent ideas is crucial to make innovation come to life. We live a very open discussion culture and prefer the evaluation of ideas based on merit over top-down decision making.We strongly believe in ownership of one\\'s features, from spec to implementation to operation. We also understand that ownership comes with a sense of responsibility towards others that depend on the results of our work.We believe that that everybody should be able to find meaning in their work. We match assignments based on both ability and individual interests and discuss your progress and individual needs every 3 months.We don\\'t see people as \"resources\" and genuinely care about each other. We also understand that there\\'s more than fancy perks and cool events to people\\'s satisfaction and engagement. We continuously work towards an environment providing a lot of autonomy, transparency and development opportunities and rely on everybody\\'s feedback to hold us accountable for maintaining our high standards.About the interview processHow we get to know each otherWe like to start out with a brief 20-30min session for a mutual introduction. We tell you about our company, product and culture and are happy to answer any questions you might have. From your side, we\\'re mostly interested in understanding what kind of challenges you\\'re looking for, what technologies you\\'d like to work with and what role you\\'d like to be in.If both sides agree that this could be a good fit, we move on to a more technical session. We ask you to walk us through one of your past projects as if we were new colleagues joining you on the job. The ability to communicate effectively and concisely about complex systems and trade-offs between different approaches is key.In a second technical session, we discuss some of the technologies and concepts you have used. We also give you a walk-through of our product and solutions, discuss our architecture and components. Finally we try to scope your initial role and focus — should you be joining us.In the last session, we discuss the remaining details, logistics and plan your relocation.We see the interview process as a mutual opportunity to get to know each other — at eye level. That\\'s why we won\\'t ask you to work for free on any coding assignments and always strive for responding within hours, not weeks.',\n",

You are designing and living in code? And above all that, you know how to play in a team, because only in a collaborative environment the best ideas can become a reality?
