Thousands of qa testers work with us to test mobile apps, websites, IoT software, and more.\nTesters who work with us come from all walks of life. Some are software developers or testers, looking to hone their skills or test on new platforms. Others are tech enthusiasts who turn their passion into extra cash. And some are students or are transitioning into a new career, earning while learning. With test IO, you can work when, where, and how you want.\nThere\u2019s no application process. You can get started here: http://hello.test.io/bsj/\nRequirements\nYou\u2019ll be working as a freelance tester, with opportunities to participate in test runs at your own discretion. You don\u2019t need to have experience in software QA (though you\u2019ll get up to speed faster if you do), but you\u2019ll need to stick with it if you\u2019ve never done it before. If you haven\u2019t tested before, here are some key success factors:\nYou read instructions and understand them. If the instructions say that something is out of scope and you test it, you\u2019re wasting your own time.\nYou communicate precisely in English. Bug reporting is a particular form of communication that demands precision, concise wording, and logical ordering.\nYou are curious. The best testers aren\u2019t robots who follow a script. They like things that seem mysterious. They deviate from the Happy Path. They like to experiment with apps.\nYou spot patterns. Similar bugs occur in unrelated software systems, so being able to sense patterns is very helpful.\nYou like games. There does seem to be a high degree of overlap between testers and gamers. Part of it is the thrill of the hunt, and the desire to understand the rules of a system and how to beat them.\nWhen you start as a tester at test IO, you\u2019ll get coaching from team leaders, then participate in test cycles with more experienced testers. You\u2019ll get the opportunity to see the kinds of issues they find and how they find them, so you\u2019ll be able to learn as you go along.\nYou will need a computer and an internet connection. Ideally you will also have access to one or more mobile devices. The more devices you have, the more opportunities you\u2019ll have to test. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have the latest hardware; there\u2019s strong demand for older devices, too.\nBenefits\nAs a tester, you can work whenever you want, from wherever you want. You\u2019ll be presented with opportunities to participate in tests, which you may accept or reject with no penalty. You will be paid for issues you find, issues that you reproduce, and sometimes for reviews of the software under test. More serious issues get higher payouts, up to $50 per bug. You\u2019ll know the payscale before you agree to test.\nThere\u2019s no formal application process. You can get started right away by signing up here: http://hello.test.io/bsj/\nYou\u2019ll then proceed to your first test, where we will help you learn how to file reports on the issues you find.", "jobtitle": "Freelance Software QA Tester", "source": "Berlin Startup Jobs"}, {"": "228", "ID": "229", "company_name": "Geschenkidee.de", "date": "2017-10-02", "description": "Your challenge:\n\nSupport the development of our Magento e-Commerce Platform for 13 international shops\nBuilding of efficient, testable, and reusable PHP modules, including responsibility for clean and reusable code\nWork with high load websites, processing large amount of structured and unstructured data\nImprove and maintain existing codebase for maximum speed and scalability\nOptimize code, Troubleshoot and debug applications\nSupport a culture of knowledge sharing and software best practices\n\nYour profile:\n\nBroad knowledge and experience in Back-End development, preferably in e-Commerce environment\nUniversity degree in the field of computer science or a similar field\nExcellent knowledge on OOP, SOLID, clean code, design patters\nProfessional experience with PHP5+, PHP7, Git, Magento, MySQL, Redis, Nginx/Apache, Javascript, API/REST/SOAP\nExperience with TDD/BDD, Jenkins, RabbitMQ/Kafka, ElasticSearch/Solr, NoSQL would be desired\nBonus points: Magento Certified CE/EE, Zend Framework, Laravel, AWS, Docker\nYou bring an analytical mindset, problem-solving abilities and a get-it-done attitude\nYou are a flexible and fast learner, who is a strong communicator with very fluent English\n\nOur offer:\n\nAn international, team-oriented and collaborative environment where you can take responsibility from Day 1\nA skilled IT department who will challenge your ping pong skills once in a while\nA dynamic and motivated Geschenkidee family with flat hierarchies\nDaily challenges and successes and a steep learning curve\n\nCurious?
