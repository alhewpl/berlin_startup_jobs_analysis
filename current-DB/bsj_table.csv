 adjust	Backend Developer 	"Audience Builder enables our customers to set up retargeting campaigns with partners immediately, by defining segmentation rules for the audiences. We launched this game changing feature beginning of this year, and there are still lots of features to implement and lots of partners to integrate it with to maintain our market leadership. This is where we need your help on!
In this role you’ll be taking over services that comprise our Audience Builder product. You will have to dig into the dashboard codebase and make yourself (with our help ofc.) comfortable contributing before you will start to implement your first Audience Builder features and its integration independently.
Integration with third-parties like Facebook and Google is an important part of the Audience Builder and our dashboard backend. You will maintain existing and develop new API backends for a number of our services. Additionally, you’ll be contributing to our dashboard backend services that we are constantly improving and since almost every feature requires dashboard support it needs to be kept up to date.
You’ll face the challenge of building robust integrations with various third party APIs while keeping it simple and unified experience for our customers. Existing pieces are written in Elixir and Ruby, besides Go and Scala that are used in the company and might be therefore beneficial to know as well.
Does this sound like a interesting challenge for you? Our petabytes of data are waiting for you, residing on a fleet of machines. Please, also keep in mind that naive approaches might not work anymore and that most of our features touch more than one service, that will require from you close coordination with other teams, such as data, dashboard, UI and product teams."	2017-10-02	Berlin Startup Jobs

 Small Improvements	Team Lead – Full Stack 	"Who we are
We’re a team of 25 people on 3 continents and looking to grow. Our product is a feedback platform. Our clients’ staff use it to give and receive feedback about their work, to set goals and objectives and to praise each other for a job well done. (We use it internally too of course.) It’s a userfriendly product, enabled by a very configurable and complex backend.
What you’ll do
You’ll be in charge of a team of 4, developing medium-sized features right away, and within months you’ll tackle some of our hardest problems.
You’ll participate at the planning stage of features and refactorings and make your voice heard. You’ll work closely with designers and with product management, and if you’re keen you can meet and discuss with clients too.
You’ll spend roughly 50% of the time coding, the other half you’ll be working with the team, conducting 1:1s, organising planning meetings and retrospectives, helping with hiring, organising the work in general, and keeping everyone happy and engaged.
Small Improvements offers flexibility and interesting challenges: One quarter your team will build an entirely new feature, the next quarter you’ll refine an existing one, and then you’ll work on nonfunctional requirements such as performance, security or architecture for a while.
Our tech stack includes Java on Google App Engine, Spring, Groovy & Spock, Elastic Search, Kibana, Gradle, React, Gulp, Webpack and some Node. Learn more on our Tech Stack page.
Who we’re looking for
This is a very hands-on position. You’ll fit in perfectly if:

You just love to code, and improve every day. You are either very strong on the frontend (React) or on the backend (Java)
You have at least 3 (ideally far more) years of experience coding fast-paced web applications and products
You have managed a small team for at least 18 months already, and can share success stories and failures alike
You strive for clean code and know how to test thoroughly
You have worked with agile processes and in small companies
You’re pragmatic and have a history of getting things launched
You’re an excellent communicator, both in writing and in person
You’re driven to succeed, but you’re humble and understand that it’s not about you but about the team
You can provide strong references both from people you led and from your senior managers

We’re serious about our open and tolerant company culture, and we value diversity. We’re looking for friendly and bright people who can develop a great product without developing a huge ego.
More reasons to work at SI

We’re international: We sell mainly to the US and to Australia, and all our written communication is in English.
We’re self-funded, transparent and profitable, and our customer base is growing.
We frequently ship new features and focus on quality product rather than on aggressive sales.
There are very few regular meetings, and processes are kept to a bare minimum. Need to improve some process? Just do it!
You’ll participate in our Hackathons and ShipIt weeks, and you’ll contribute to our product blog and to our tech blog.
Our office between S Hackescher Markt and U8 Weinmeisterstrasse is stylish yet cozy, and it has has plenty of doors to reduce distractions to a minimum.
There are free snacks, fresh fruit, juices, tea and lemonades, you can make your own lattes with our amazing coffee machine, and we never run out of Club Mate."	2017-10-02	Berlin Startup Jobs

 test IO	Freelance Software QA Tester 	"test IO is a global leader in software crowdtesting. Thousands of qa testers work with us to test mobile apps, websites, IoT software, and more.
Testers who work with us come from all walks of life. Some are software developers or testers, looking to hone their skills or test on new platforms. Others are tech enthusiasts who turn their passion into extra cash. And some are students or are transitioning into a new career, earning while learning. With test IO, you can work when, where, and how you want.
There’s no application process. You can get started here: http://hello.test.io/bsj/
Requirements
You’ll be working as a freelance tester, with opportunities to participate in test runs at your own discretion. You don’t need to have experience in software QA (though you’ll get up to speed faster if you do), but you’ll need to stick with it if you’ve never done it before. If you haven’t tested before, here are some key success factors:
You read instructions and understand them. If the instructions say that something is out of scope and you test it, you’re wasting your own time.
You communicate precisely in English. Bug reporting is a particular form of communication that demands precision, concise wording, and logical ordering.
You are curious. The best testers aren’t robots who follow a script. They like things that seem mysterious. They deviate from the Happy Path. They like to experiment with apps.
You spot patterns. Similar bugs occur in unrelated software systems, so being able to sense patterns is very helpful.
You like games. There does seem to be a high degree of overlap between testers and gamers. Part of it is the thrill of the hunt, and the desire to understand the rules of a system and how to beat them.
When you start as a tester at test IO, you’ll get coaching from team leaders, then participate in test cycles with more experienced testers. You’ll get the opportunity to see the kinds of issues they find and how they find them, so you’ll be able to learn as you go along.
You will need a computer and an internet connection. Ideally you will also have access to one or more mobile devices. The more devices you have, the more opportunities you’ll have to test. Don’t worry if you don’t have the latest hardware; there’s strong demand for older devices, too.
Benefits
As a tester, you can work whenever you want, from wherever you want. You’ll be presented with opportunities to participate in tests, which you may accept or reject with no penalty. You will be paid for issues you find, issues that you reproduce, and sometimes for reviews of the software under test. More serious issues get higher payouts, up to $50 per bug. You’ll know the payscale before you agree to test.
There’s no formal application process. You can get started right away by signing up here: http://hello.test.io/bsj/
You’ll then proceed to your first test, where we will help you learn how to file reports on the issues you find."	2017-10-02	Berlin Startup Jobs

 DCMN GmbH	Senior DevOps Engineer (m/f) 	"We’re looking someone (an “experienced DevOps Engineer” if you wish) to guide the operational side of our tech team. You’ll get your hands dirty and have to maintain, grow, and optimize our development infrastructure, but the focus will be on driving the culture to enable the team to maintain the infrastructure, not on maintaining it yourself.
We’re currently a ~20 person tech team deploying three products across a mix of bare metal and AWS infrastructure. We are explicitly looking for someone to coordinate the whole team’s efforts and provide experience and vision for how to set up and maintain a clean infrastructure. That is, we’d like you to provide ideas and enable everyone to work on infrastructure without pulling their hair out. We’re generally very open to doing things the “right way” if you can convince us that that’s what it is.
The kind of questions we’d like to answer together

Should we move everything to the cloud or to bare metal?
Do we want containers and which scheduler should we use?
We need to scale our product globally: Should we set up a “satellite system” in Asia due to latency requirements, or will Europe be good enough for now? What can we keep here, what needs to go into the satellite? How do we synchronize storage? How much would it cost?
How can we unify our rather diverse provision/build/test/deployment structure (chef, salt, docker, jenkins, make, …)?
How can we make environments available for development and for staging, production branches? Both for developers across Linux and Mac OS and for the product team?

Some things you’ll get to play around with:

a bare metal RTB set-up handling 100k requests per second
a Spark data science pipeline processing a few hundreds of GB per day
PostgreSQL replication and failover
MySQL on RDS
Aerospike/Redis/Elasticsearch clusters

Requirements

You should be able to provide well-founded input to questions like the above
You are able to understand and modify our current deployment automation tooling
Experience in administering and automating networking, Linux, AWS or similar
Experience in troubleshooting networking and systems failures
Fluent in English (written and spoken)

What’s in it for you?

Work in a dynamic, experienced team of outstanding developers
Be a part of an elite international team – we have 30 nationalities!
Working with the latest technologies
Take full responsibility from day one
Home-office and remote work friendly, matched with flexible working hours.
We’re not cheap, you’ll get a nice screen or two
Free language courses, pilates classes and massages during and outside work time
We live work/life balance (!)
A recently remodelled and trendy office in a building with other great digital companies in one of the hottest neighbourhoods in Berlin,

PASSION for tech; it’s something many companies speak about, but at Affinitas, we put those words into action! We were one of the earliest startups in Berlin from the ‘new wave’ of tech startups. In fact, we’re practically startup royalty – successful (and profitable) with fun plans for expansion.
Affinitas brands are on the ‘serious dating’ side of the spectrum of dating platforms (an antidote to the casual hookup brands flooding the market). Elite Singles, eDarling, and Attractive World are our main brands aimed at professionals looking for love.
So; want to make a difference in the lives of millions of singles? Are you interested in joining an ambitious and inclusive workplace? The tech teams are continually striving for the highest quality, quick-release solutions.

You care about time to first byte, rendering performance, delightful user experiences and how to make web sites accessible and usable for everyone.
Test-driven, clean-code, continuously deployed and all the lovely stuff that’s involved with automatically testing defines you as a great developer.
Let us be explicit; you will write your own tests. You also may be an expert on thinking critically about potential flaws, and are able to teach others on this subject. You have depth of experience, but are open to being more broad too. For example, our Java developers learn from the Javascript experts, and vice versa. Having a desire to expand and master something new means you’re a good fit for us.
As our company offers platforms all over the world and has lots of different nationalities, we made English our company language. Your English skills should be sufficient to have day to day conversations and read this job description.

We Offer:

Super smart, dynamic, international team members. Highly skilled people striving for results; professional but with a fantastic sense of humour.
A competitive salary, great benefits and an excellent working environment.
Berlin startup amenities, such as nice laptops, and great office facilities (fair warning though: don’t be too sad when we beat you at table tennis or kicker in the beginning, as we’ve been training a lot).

 ChartMogul	Frontend Engineer (F/M) 	"One of the cool things about working at ChartMogul is that, when you tell people where you work, they’ve often actually heard of us. But in case you haven’t, here’s what we do: we take the raw transaction data that subscription businesses – like Pipedrive, Typeform and Travis CI – generate when they bill their customers, and turn it into high level business metrics – like Monthly Recurring Revenue and churn rate – that they use to make their businesses grow faster than ever. We give almost anyone the tools to segment and analyse this data, instantly, without bothering a BI team. We’re democratising analytics.
We’d love to say all this was powered by amazing, gleaming code, perfectly architected and running on an automated, containerised fleet of servers. But we’re a young company – just 3 years old, and 20 people – and we’ve made our share of mistakes as we’ve grown. There’s a certain amount of (though not too much) of technical debt. Our main Rails application only has a Code Climate GPA of 3.15. And there are some architectural decisions we’d definitely make differently with the benefit of hindsight. We’re learning all the time how to be better engineers.
But we’re doing a lot of cool stuff too. We use Rust in production. Our customers love us, and we’re growing – which brings challenges with it. And we’re looking for a first dedicated Frontend Engineer to keep improving our UI, and making our customers’ lives easier every day.
What we’re looking for: 

A few years’ experience working with single-page applications in a modern, JavaScript stack.
Experience with Marionette / Backbone, which we presently use, would be particularly great.
Good knowledge of the browser environment, and JavaScript toolchains.
A good understanding of building solid, maintainable code.
You speak fluent Git, and English.
You like working with other team members, and even customers to understand and solve their problems.

What we offer:
Obviously, we offer good salaries to attract great people to ChartMogul. We offer 5 weeks of leave per year, and we actually encourage people to use it. We’ve got a cool office (literally – it has air-conditioning!) right near Nordbahnhof, and the usual drinks and snacks. We’re flexible about letting people take time to do other things in their life, and working from home."	2017-10-02	Berlin Startup Jobs

ABOUT US
When watching any visual media (TV/movies or streaming videos of music, fashion, beauty and fitness on platforms such as YouTube) consumers have no convenient way to purchase items they see.
Retailers have no efficient way to sell consumers the products used and seen in visual media, especially at the moment of impulse. Content creators cannot monetize product sales of items they use in their productions.
Demand is left unsatisfied; billions in lost opportunity.
Geenee is the first mobile app that enables viewers to purchase any item they see while watching TV, movies or streaming video. Snap a picture of a TV with a mobile device or use the app’s snap button when watching content on smart phones or tablets. The exact products appear listed, instantly. Click to connect online; buy anything seen. Impulse – Shop – Sale in less then 20 seconds.
Geenee creates a new mobile sales channel.

 Small Improvements	Full-stack Developer (ReactJS, Java, Google Cloud) 	"We help our customers communicate better. We serve SoundCloud, Quiksilver, Pinterest, Sendgrid and 700 more.
Do you like backend and frontend-code alike, and are happy to fill in the gaps that you might still have? We’re now looking for a Full Stack Developer (ReactJS, Java) who enjoys feature work and architecture alike.
About us
Our product is a feedback platform. Our clients’ staff use it to give and receive feedback about their work, to set goals and objectives and to praise each other for a job well done. (We use it internally too of course.) It’s a userfriendly product, enabled by a very configurable and complex backend.
Our tech stack includes Java on Google App Engine, Spring, Groovy & Spock, Elastic Search, Kibana, Gradle, React, Gulp, Webpack and some Node. Learn more on our Tech Stack page.
What you’ll do
You’ll be in charge of developing medium-sized features right away: You’ll participate at the planning stage and make your voice heard. You’ll work closely with designers and with our customer success team, and you’ll demo prototypes to clients to gather their feedback. You’ll help writing release notes, a launch blogpost and the documentation too.
Small Improvements is ever-changing: One month you’ll build an entirely new feature, one month you’ll refine an existing one, and then you’ll spend some time on nonfunctional requirements such as performance, security or architecture.
Who we’re looking for
This is a very hands-on position. You’ll fit in perfectly if:

You just love to code, and improve every day
You have 3+ years of experience on fast-paced web applications and products
You strive for clean maintainable code, and know how to test thoroughly
You have worked with agile processes and in small companies
You’re pragmatic and have a history of getting things launched
You’re a self-starter who will seek out product improvements on your own

We’re serious about our open and tolerant company culture. We’re looking for friendly and bright people who can develop a great product without developing a huge ego.
More reasons to work at SI

We’re international: We sell mainly to the US and to Australia, and all our written communication is in English.
We’re self-funded, transparent and profitable, and our customer base is growing.
We frequently ship new features and focus on quality product rather than on aggressive sales.
There are very few regular meetings, and processes are kept to a bare minimum. Need to improve some process? Just do it!
You’ll participate in our Hackathons and ShipIt weeks, and you’ll contribute to our product blog and to our tech blog.
Our office between S Hackescher Markt and U8 Weinmeisterstrasse is stylish yet cozy, and it has has plenty of doors to reduce distractions to a minimum.
There are free snacks, fresh fruit, juices, tea and lemonades, you can make your own lattes with our amazing coffee machine, and we never run out of Club Mate."	2017-10-02	Berlin Startup Jobs
