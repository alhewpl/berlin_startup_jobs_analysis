We recently launched a brand new contactless device, which makes paying by card easier than ever before.</p><br /><p><strong>Why work with us?</strong></p><br /><p>SumUp could be interesting for you as an engineer in part because we cover so many platforms: we have physical hardware (made right here in Berlin), our own proprietary payment processing platform, mobile apps on iOS and Android, SDKs and APIs supporting third-party integration, and of course (the main star, in this team''s humble opinion) a merchant-facing web app.</p><br /><p><strong>What we''re looking for</strong></p><br /><p>A web developer with Javascript expertise, who will be able to contribute to and benefit from our team''s ambition to improve our app, our code, and our technical abilities every day.</p><br /><p>To us, fullstack means you are comfortable working with the machine on all the levels most meaningful for web today: you''re familiar with Node, you''re comfortable with Unix as it relates to your work, you''re familiar with developing frontend apps in JavaScript, as well as making them look decent with HTML/(S)CSS based on specs provided by designers.</p><br /><p>This position is frontend heavy in its day-to-day responsibilities, but requires a thorough knowledge of the full stack to operate efficiently.</p><br /><p><strong>You''ll fit in perfectly to our team if:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>You not only love coding, but also take the time to reflect on the benefits and drawbacks of your tools, be they frameworks, languages, or processes.</li><br /><li>You strive for clean code, but also know how to make your "shortcuts" easy to delete in a crunch.</li><br /><li>You know what to test, why to test it, and how to write flexible tests that won''t break with minor changes.</li><br /><li>You''re comfortable with Linux and know how to get things done on the command line, including on remote servers.</li><br /><li>You have experience with or interest in Functional Programming techniques.</li><br /><li>You''re not afraid to use Google or ask for help when something is beyond your grasp.</li><br /><li>You care about user interaction, usability, and of course &ndash; making the interface beautiful.</li><br /><li>In general, technology excites you and you strive to learn something on a daily basis!</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Our tech stack and projects</strong></p><br /><p><em>Dashboard:</em> A modern Angular 1.5 application helping merchants keep track of their revenue and manage their accounts. Our core features include sales analytics, a transaction overview, and account management. Right now we''re working on integrating AWS to power document upload and re-thinking our shop. Our Angular codebase uses a modern component approach and pure services supported by Jasmine unit tests. Apart from that, we heavily use JavaScript libraries like Lodash, Moment.js, and d3 and rely on Gulp and Webpack for our build and deployment tasks. Naturally, our codebase is in ES6.</p><br /><p><em>Website</em>: Our website uses Jekyll and is served by a Node server (using Koa, the spiritual successor to Express) that''s largely powered by a headless CMS (which we don''t maintain, win!). The Javascript is microscopic, organized into components, bundled with webpack, and uses jQuery and Lodash for convenience. We''re keen on SEO and optimizing the merchant''s very first impressions of our product.</p><br /><p><em>On our roadmap:</em> We''re always looking at what''s happening in the ever-changing web development space. We''re currently investigating React as an alternative to Angular, moving to Webpack 2, and adding a type system like Flow or TypeScript.</p><br /><p>The backend that powers SumUp is a constellation of microservices, mostly written in Ruby but with an increasing number powered by Node.

You''ll use this knowledge to start developing and refining features. You''ll learn how we write tests, how we manage application state, and how we keep performance tip-top. You''ll also pitch in on our Jekyll site to enable sales and marketing to reach hundreds of thousands of visitors every month.</p><br /><p>In the first three months, you''ll develop major features that impact our merchant base.
