You’re an excellent communicator, both in writing and in person
You’re driven to succeed, but you’re humble and understand that it’s not about you but about the team

227,228,test IO,2017-10-02,"test IO is a global leader in software crowdtesting. Thousands of qa testers work with us to test mobile apps, websites, IoT software, and more.
Testers who work with us come from all walks of life. Some are software developers or testers, looking to hone their skills or test on new platforms. Others are tech enthusiasts who turn their passion into extra cash. And some are students or are transitioning into a new career, earning while learning. With test IO, you can work when, where, and how you want.
There’s no application process. You can get started here: http://hello.test.io/bsj/
Requirements
You’ll be working as a freelance tester, with opportunities to participate in test runs at your own discretion. You don’t need to have experience in software QA (though you’ll get up to speed faster if you do), but you’ll need to stick with it if you’ve never done it before. If you haven’t tested before, here are some key success factors:
You read instructions and understand them. If the instructions say that something is out of scope and you test it, you’re wasting your own time.
You communicate precisely in English. Bug reporting is a particular form of communication that demands precision, concise wording, and logical ordering.
You are curious. The best testers aren’t robots who follow a script. They like things that seem mysterious. They deviate from the Happy Path. They like to experiment with apps.
You spot patterns. Similar bugs occur in unrelated software systems, so being able to sense patterns is very helpful.
You like games. There does seem to be a high degree of overlap between testers and gamers. Part of it is the thrill of the hunt, and the desire to understand the rules of a system and how to beat them.
When you start as a tester at test IO, you’ll get coaching from team leaders, then participate in test cycles with more experienced testers. You’ll get the opportunity to see the kinds of issues they find and how they find them, so you’ll be able to learn as you go along.
You will need a computer and an internet connection. Ideally you will also have access to one or more mobile devices. The more devices you have, the more opportunities you’ll have to test. Don’t worry if you don’t have the latest hardware; there’s strong demand for older devices, too.
Benefits
As a tester, you can work whenever you want, from wherever you want. You’ll be presented with opportunities to participate in tests, which you may accept or reject with no penalty. You will be paid for issues you find, issues that you reproduce, and sometimes for reviews of the software under test. More serious issues get higher payouts, up to $50 per bug. You’ll know the payscale before you agree to test.
There’s no formal application process. You can get started right away by signing up here: http://hello.test.io/bsj/

You’ll get your hands dirty and have to maintain, grow, and optimize our development infrastructure, but the focus will be on driving the culture to enable the team to maintain the infrastructure, not on maintaining it yourself.
We’re currently a ~20 person tech team deploying three products across a mix of bare metal and AWS infrastructure. We are explicitly looking for someone to coordinate the whole team’s efforts and provide experience and vision for how to set up and maintain a clean infrastructure. That is, we’d like you to provide ideas and enable everyone to work on infrastructure without pulling their hair out. We’re generally very open to doing things the “right way” if you can convince us that that’s what it is.
The kind of questions we’d like to answer together

Should we move everything to the cloud or to bare metal?
Do we want containers and which scheduler should we use?
We need to scale our product globally: Should we set up a “satellite system” in Asia due to latency requirements, or will Europe be good enough for now? What can we keep here, what needs to go into the satellite? How do we synchronize storage? How much would it cost?
How can we unify our rather diverse provision/build/test/deployment structure (chef, salt, docker, jenkins, make, …)?
How can we make environments available for development and for staging, production branches? Both for developers across Linux and Mac OS and for the product team?

Some things you’ll get to play around with:

a bare metal RTB set-up handling 100k requests per second
a Spark data science pipeline processing a few hundreds of GB per day
PostgreSQL replication and failover
MySQL on RDS
Aerospike/Redis/Elasticsearch clusters

Requirements

You should be able to provide well-founded input to questions like the above
You are able to understand and modify our current deployment automation tooling
Experience in administering and automating networking, Linux, AWS or similar
Experience in troubleshooting networking and systems failures
Fluent in English (written and spoken)

What’s in it for you?

Work in a dynamic, experienced team of outstanding developers
Be a part of an elite international team – we have 30 nationalities!
Working with the latest technologies
Take full responsibility from day one

468,469,ChartMogul,2017-10-02,"One of the cool things about working at ChartMogul is that, when you tell people where you work, they’ve often actually heard of us. But in case you haven’t, here’s what we do: we take the raw transaction data that subscription businesses – like Pipedrive, Typeform and Travis CI – generate when they bill their customers, and turn it into high level business metrics – like Monthly Recurring Revenue and churn rate – that they use to make their businesses grow faster than ever. We give almost anyone the tools to segment and analyse this data, instantly, without bothering a BI team. We’re democratising analytics.
We’d love to say all this was powered by amazing, gleaming code, perfectly architected and running on an automated, containerised fleet of servers. But we’re a young company – just 3 years old, and 20 people – and we’ve made our share of mistakes as we’ve grown. There’s a certain amount of (though not too much) of technical debt. Our main Rails application only has a Code Climate GPA of 3.15. And there are some architectural decisions we’d definitely make differently with the benefit of hindsight. We’re learning all the time how to be better engineers.
But we’re doing a lot of cool stuff too. We use Rust in production. Our customers love us, and we’re growing – which brings challenges with it. And we’re looking for a first dedicated Frontend Engineer to keep improving our UI, and making our customers’ lives easier every day.
What we’re looking for: 

A few years’ experience working with single-page applications in a modern, JavaScript stack.
Experience with Marionette / Backbone, which we presently use, would be particularly great.
Good knowledge of the browser environment, and JavaScript toolchains.
A good understanding of building solid, maintainable code.
You speak fluent Git, and English.
You like working with other team members, and even customers to understand and solve their problems.

ABOUT US
When watching any visual media (TV/movies or streaming videos of music, fashion, beauty and fitness on platforms such as YouTube) consumers have no convenient way to purchase items they see.
Retailers have no efficient way to sell consumers the products used and seen in visual media, especially at the moment of impulse. Content creators cannot monetize product sales of items they use in their productions.
Demand is left unsatisfied; billions in lost opportunity.
Geenee is the first mobile app that enables viewers to purchase any item they see while watching TV, movies or streaming video. Snap a picture of a TV with a mobile device or use the app’s snap button when watching content on smart phones or tablets. The exact products appear listed, instantly. Click to connect online; buy anything seen. Impulse – Shop – Sale in less then 20 seconds.
Geenee creates a new mobile sales channel.

Do you like backend and frontend-code alike, and are happy to fill in the gaps that you might still have? We’re now looking for a Full Stack Developer (ReactJS, Java) who enjoys feature work and architecture alike.
About us
Our product is a feedback platform. Our clients’ staff use it to give and receive feedback about their work, to set goals and objectives and to praise each other for a job well done. (We use it internally too of course.) It’s a userfriendly product, enabled by a very configurable and complex backend.
Our tech stack includes Java on Google App Engine, Spring, Groovy & Spock, Elastic Search, Kibana, Gradle, React, Gulp, Webpack and some Node. Learn more on our Tech Stack page.
What you’ll do
You’ll be in charge of developing medium-sized features right away: You’ll participate at the planning stage and make your voice heard. You’ll work closely with designers and with our customer success team, and you’ll demo prototypes to clients to gather their feedback. You’ll help writing release notes, a launch blogpost and the documentation too.
Small Improvements is ever-changing: One month you’ll build an entirely new feature, one month you’ll refine an existing one, and then you’ll spend some time on nonfunctional requirements such as performance, security or architecture.
Who we’re looking for
This is a very hands-on position. You’ll fit in perfectly if:

You just love to code, and improve every day
You have 3+ years of experience on fast-paced web applications and products
You strive for clean maintainable code, and know how to test thoroughly
You have worked with agile processes and in small companies
You’re pragmatic and have a history of getting things launched
You’re a self-starter who will seek out product improvements on your own

We’re serious about our open and tolerant company culture. We’re looking for friendly and bright people who can develop a great product without developing a huge ego.
More reasons to work at SI

We’re international: We sell mainly to the US and to Australia, and all our written communication is in English.
We’re self-funded, transparent and profitable, and our customer base is growing.
We frequently ship new features and focus on quality product rather than on aggressive sales.
There are very few regular meetings, and processes are kept to a bare minimum. Need to improve some process? Just do it!
You’ll participate in our Hackathons and ShipIt weeks, and you’ll contribute to our product blog and to our tech blog.
Our office between S Hackescher Markt and U8 Weinmeisterstrasse is stylish yet cozy, and it has has plenty of doors to reduce distractions to a minimum.
There are free snacks, fresh fruit, juices, tea and lemonades, you can make your own lattes with our amazing coffee machine, and we never run out of Club Mate.","full stack developer (reactjs, java, google cloud)",Berlin Startup Jobs,full stack developer ,False,False,False,False,2

We prefer to keep our schedule meeting-light and work in a library-like atmosphere during the core hours.We believe the ability to give and get constructive feedback and express divergent ideas is crucial to make innovation come to life. We live a very open discussion culture and prefer the evaluation of ideas based on merit over top-down decision making.We strongly believe in ownership of one's features, from spec to implementation to operation. We also understand that ownership comes with a sense of responsibility towards others that depend on the results of our work.We believe that that everybody should be able to find meaning in their work. We match assignments based on both ability and individual interests and discuss your progress and individual needs every 3 months.We don't see people as ""resources"" and genuinely care about each other. We also understand that there's more than fancy perks and cool events to people's satisfaction and engagement. We continuously work towards an environment providing a lot of autonomy, transparency and development opportunities and rely on everybody's feedback to hold us accountable for maintaining our high standards.About the interview processHow we get to know each otherWe like to start out with a brief 20-30min session for a mutual introduction. We tell you about our company, product and culture and are happy to answer any questions you might have. From your side, we're mostly interested in understanding what kind of challenges you're looking for, what technologies you'd like to work with and what role you'd like to be in.If both sides agree that this could be a good fit, we move on to a more technical session. We ask you to walk us through one of your past projects as if we were new colleagues joining you on the job. The ability to communicate effectively and concisely about complex systems and trade-offs between different approaches is key.In a second technical session, we discuss some of the technologies and concepts you have used. We also give you a walk-through of our product and solutions, discuss our architecture and components. Finally we try to scope your initial role and focus — should you be joining us.In the last session, we discuss the remaining details, logistics and plan your relocation.We see the interview process as a mutual opportunity to get to know each other — at eye level. That's why we won't ask you to work for free on any coding assignments and always strive for responding within hours, not weeks.",senior data scientist (python scala),Stackoverflow,senior data scientist ,False,False,False,True,33
